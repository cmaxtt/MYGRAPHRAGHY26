SQL Query Examples Document

This document contains various SQL queries for testing the SQL query retrieval system.

1. SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as order_count FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

2. INSERT INTO products (name, price, category) VALUES ('Laptop', 999.99, 'Electronics'), ('Mouse', 29.99, 'Accessories');

3. UPDATE users SET last_login = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE user_id = 123;

4. DELETE FROM logs WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

5. CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

6. SELECT 
    c.name as customer_name,
    SUM(o.total) as total_spent,
    AVG(o.total) as avg_order_value
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;

7. ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN stock_quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

8. DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temporary_data;

These are example queries that should be extracted and indexed.
